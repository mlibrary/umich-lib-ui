<Text lede>This Design System is a bit like a branded lego kit for creating high quality user interfaces at the University of Michigan Library.</Text>

## Distributed as React components

The Design System is distributed as [React components](/about/glossary/#react) and published on the NPM registry. This means to use the Design System in your project, you will need to understand and use React.

Learn more about [why we chose to go with React](/articles/why-react) and what that means for teams who don't use React.

## But what about copy pasting regular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript?

We’re so glad you’re interested, but vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is not available yet. [Get in touch](/about/design-system-team#contact-us) if you’re interested to help us prioritize and plan distributing the design system in other formats.

## How the Design System is organized

### Styles

Styles make your service look and feel like a U-M Library service. The design system provides colors, typography, layout, iconography, and more.

### Components

Components are reusable tangible parts of the user interface, such as a button, an icon, or something more involved like displaying record fields. Components can be composed just like HTML elements.

### Patterns

Patterns are repeating, reusable parts of the interface that can be applied and repurposed to solve a specific design problem, meet a user need, or evoke an emotion, such as handling form errors or getting feedback.

This includes helping users fill out forms, handling errors and validation, and getting feedback from users.
