## Design System terms

### Design System 

A collection of shared design patterns for teams to build quality consistent interfaces. A bit like a LEGO kit.

### Styles

These are more descriptive and less tangible design patterns, such as iconography styles or colors and typography, typically used to create a certain kind of aesthetic to make your service look and feel like a U-M Library website.

### Components

Re-usable tangible parts of the user interface, such as a button, a heading, or an icon.

### Patterns

Repeating, reusable parts of the interface that can be applied and repurposed to solve a specific design problem, meet a user need, or evoke an emotion, such as handling form errors or getting feedback.

## Development terms

### GitHub
Github is an all-in-one platform for collaborative development. It hosts our git repos and provides a mechanism for peer review.

### Git
Git is at the core of how we do collaborative development. It's a version control system tool which allows us to work on the same codebases in a safe and fairly easy way.

### Repo / repository
A single project in git is called a repository and often abbreviated as repo by developers.

### Fork / forking
A copy of a repository. Forking allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. Forks are also commonly used to propose changes to someone else's project.

### Branch
A branch starts as a snapshot of the current codebase and then diverges as the developer makes changes.

We create a branch when we start a new piece of work, and only apply it to the main codebase once it is complete.

### Master
Development teams use of git works where developers work on topic branchs (generally a copy of the master branch at the time work starts) and only once work has been completed (including testing) the work is applied to master branch.

When work is applied to the master branch, actions are generally triggered, depending on the project. These actions include things like deploying the work to the staging sites, releasing a new version of a package, and publishing the pattern library.

### Merge
While merging can refer to merging between any branches, generally when developers talk about merging they are discussing merging to the master branch.

### Pull request / PR
Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a GitHub repository. Once a pull request is sent, interested parties can review the set of changes, discuss potential modifications, and even push follow-up commits if necessary.

### Component
A component is a highly loaded term in development, it can mean a React Component and sometimes is used to refer to a piece of functionality/tool.

### React
A JavaScript library for building component-based user interfaces. It is used as the foundation to building components for this design system.

### Props
Similar to HTML attributes. React components take inputs (called "props") and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.
