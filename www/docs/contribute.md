## Contribution criteria

The <gatsby-link to="/design-system-team">Design System team</gatsby-link> reviews porposals to check they meet the following criteria. Proposals that meet the criteria will then be marked ‘to do’, ready to be worked on.

### 1. Useful

There is evidence that it would be useful for many teams or services. Evidence could be screenshots or links to versions of it being used in different services.

### 2. Unique

It does not replicate something already in the Design System. If it’s intended to replace an existing style, component, or pattern, there is evidence to show that it’s better than the existing version.

## Propose a style, component, or pattern

### 1. Check the backlog

Check if someone else has already suggested your idea or something similar on the [community backlog](https://github.com/mlibrary/umich-lib-ui/labels/proposal).

If your idea is on the backlog and marked as ‘proposed’, follow the link and comment on the issue. Say you need the component or pattern and share any examples or evidence you have to support the proposal.

### 2. Raise an issue

If your idea is not on the backlog, [raise an issue using the template](https://github.com/mlibrary/umich-lib-ui/issues/new). A member of the Design System team will get in touch to discuss your proposal.

At this stage, you just need to present your idea and evidence of the user needs. You can include screenshots or links to versions of the component or pattern in use, but avoid spending time working on a specific design or writing code.

### 3. Send your proposal for review

The Design System team will help you prepare your proposal and share it to review. When your proposal is ready the Design System team will let you know the decision and recommendations, if there are any.

If the team finds that your proposal is useful and unique, it will be marked as ‘to do’ on the community backlog.

At this point, you can either start to develop the component or pattern or leave it for someone else to work on.

## Develop a style, component, or pattern

Anyone can choose to work on items marked ‘to do’ in the [community backlog](https://github.com/mlibrary/umich-lib-ui/labels/proposal).

If you see something you would like to work on, email the Design System team at [design-discovery@lib.umich.edu](mailto:design-discovery@lib.umich.edu).

### 1. Plan your work with the Design System team

After you’ve emailed them, a member of the Design System team will get in touch to arrange a kick-off meeting.

During the meeting, the team will help you to:

- agree the scope of your contribution
- plan what design, content, code and guidance needs working on
agree timings
- discuss any support you might need
- identify a contact for you to work with in the Design System team

If you’re happy to go ahead, the team will assign you to the issue as a contributor.

### 2. Research and develop your contribution

### 3. Send your contribution for review

### 4. Get ready to publish
